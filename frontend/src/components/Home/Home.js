        <p>
            Birders are a passionate and adventurous people. The never-ending search for new birds in places both new and familiar is a passtime that consumes us all here at AviaNatura. If you share this passion we hope you will join us for a tour, or several, as it suits your schedule. We are always designing new tours for the upcoming seasons but if you would like us to set-up a bespoke tour around your work or travel schedules in the areas we specialize in we would be delighted to accomodate you.

            <h3>Why AviaNatura?</h3>
        <p>
            We seek out guides who have devoted much or all of their lives to nature and the outdoors, and who are skilled not only at finding birds, but who share a deep understanding of nature. That's not to say it's not all about the birds, but it's about birds and their natural history and their relationship to the landscape and seasons. Our tour company is a labor of love and comraderie, and each trip is a quest
